# Architecture (current state)

`docs/BRIEF.md` is the target design. This file describes what exists and records deviations.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start.sh` | entry point: platform checks, bootstraps `uv`, syncs Python, runs `videocut setup` + `doctor` |
| `manifest/tools.json` | pinned downloads: version, URL, SHA-256, licence |
| `src/videocut/` | Python package and CLI (`setup`, `doctor`, `selftest`, `models pull`) |
| `renderer/` | Node + `playwright-core`: canvas frames in headless Chromium, piped to FFmpeg |
| `.tools/` (ignored) | installed tools: `bin/`, managed Python, Node, Chromium, caches |
| `~/VideoCut/` | user data: `models/`, `brands/`, `jobs/`, `music/`, `selftest/` (`VIDEOCUT_HOME`) |

## Decisions

- **macOS on Apple Silicon first.** Transcription runs on MLX.
- **No Homebrew, no sudo.** Everything is installed into the repository folder, so
  `uninstall.sh` can remove it completely.
- **Every download pinned and checksum-verified.** Hugging Face models are pinned to a commit
  revision; plain files and binaries to a SHA-256.
- **FFmpeg is downloaded, never redistributed.** The build with libx264 is GPL; keeping it out of
  the repository keeps the project itself Apache-2.0.
- **Managed Python** (`UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=only-managed`), so every machine runs the same
  interpreter regardless of pyenv/Homebrew.
- **Claude skills ship as a Claude Code plugin** loaded with `claude --plugin-dir`, so they work
  regardless of the job folder (to be built in the pipeline phase).
- **Agent runs are restricted** (see `SECURITY.md`); in local mode they use `--setting-sources`
  to keep the user's personal Claude Code hooks and settings out of job runs (to be verified).
